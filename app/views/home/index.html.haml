      %h1.headline Understanding the Security Practices of Network Operators
      %h3.sub-headline In this study our aim is to understand the security practices of small network operators. Through our research design, we hope to understand if and how practices are anchored in social context and the role social circles (network operators groups, vendor relationships) inform operatorâ€™s security practices. Specifically, we want to understand how this anchoring effect through it influences the results researchers receive from Likert-scale type questionnaires and surveys.
